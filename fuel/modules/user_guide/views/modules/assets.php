<h1>Assets Module</h1>
<p>The Assets module is a simple front end for managing images, CSS files, javascript etc. and 
is enabled by default in a normal installation (if your version of FUEL does not show a Assets link 
under the sites navigation on the left, you can skip this section). It will only allow you 
to manage files that have writable asset directories. One thing to point out that is different from other modules is that you cannot edit 
an asset because it exists on the file system and not in a database. You can only create or delete. 
However, upon creation, you have the ability to overwrite a file with the same name which, in essence, 
is editing the asset. Also, because assets are saved on the file system and not in a database, you can use 
an FTP client to manage the assets as well.</p>
