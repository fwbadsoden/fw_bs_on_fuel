<h1>What is FUEL CMS?</h1>
<p>At it's core, FUEL CMS is a modular based, CodeIgniter development platform for 
creating web applications. You can create your models, views and controllers 
like normal and only use the CMS part when and if you need it. It's a hybrid of 
a framework and a CMS.</p>

<p>FUEL CMS evolved out of the need for having a development platform that
was a Framework first and a CMS second. CodeIgniter fit the bill as a 
lightweight PHP framework that didn't try and do too much behind the scenes.
It allowed us to cleanly structure our code and use MVC principles (when needed).
</p>

<p>We developed it so it could be easily integrated into your existing projects 
allowing you to select where and how you want to use the CMS. The interface
is highly customizable and easily extensible with modules.</p>
