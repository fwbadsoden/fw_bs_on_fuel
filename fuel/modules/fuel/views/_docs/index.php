<h1>Welcome FUEL CMS</h1>
<p>FUEL CMS is a modular based, <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter" target="_blank">CodeIgniter</a> development platform for creating web applications. Developers can create theirs models, views and controllers and only use the CMS part when and if they need it. It's a hybrid of a framework and a CMS.</p>

<p>FUEL CMS evolved out of the need for having a development platform that was a framework first and a CMS second. CodeIgniter fit the bill as a lightweight, PHP framework, that didn't try and do too much behind the scenes. It allows developers to cleanly structure their code and use MVC principles when needed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thedaylightstudio.com" target="_blank">Daylight Studio</a> developed FUEL CMS so it could be easily integrated into existing CodeIgniter projects allowing developers to select where and how they want to use the CMS. The interface is highly customizable and easily extensible with modules.</p>
