<h2>Demo Site</h2>
<p>Sometimes the easiest way to learn is to just see it in action. There is currently a demo branch we keep up to date that uses a fictitious company called <a href="http://www.getfuelcms.com/demo" target="_blank">Widgicorp</a> to help demonstrate 
the more commonly used functionality of FUEL CMS.
You can <a href="https://github.com/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/tree/demo" target="_blank">download the demo on GitHub</a> or view it <a href="http://www.getfuelcms.com/demo" target="_blank">here</a>.
