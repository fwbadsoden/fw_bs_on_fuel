<h1>Assets</h1>
<p>The Assets module allows you to manage the images, CSS, and javascript for your sites. You must set the asset folders you want managed
to have writable permissions. Because assets are saved on the file system and not in a database, you can use 
an FTP client to manage the assets as well.</p>
